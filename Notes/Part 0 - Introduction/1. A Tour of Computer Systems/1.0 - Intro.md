- A computer system consists of hardware and systems software that work together to run application programs.
	- While specific implementations of systems change over time, the underlying concepts do not.
	- All computer systems have similar hardware and software components that perform similar functions.

We begin this study by tracing the lifetime of `hello.c`, from the time it's created by a programmer, until it runs on a system, prints its simple message, and terminates.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("hello, world\n");
	return 0;
}
```
