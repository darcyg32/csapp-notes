### Core Idea
- All information in a computer system (including files, programs, memory data, and network transfers) is represented as bits (binary digits: 0 or 1).
- The meaning of those bits depends entirely on their context.

### Key Concepts
#### 1. Source Program
- A source program (or source file) is the text file a programmer writes (e.g., `hello.c`).
- It contains human-readable code, created and saved using a text editor.
#### 2. Bits and Bytes
- **Bit**: The smallest unit of information; can be 0 or 1.
- **Bye**: A group of 8 bits. Most systems organize information in bytes.
- Each byte can represent:
	- A text character (using an encoding like ASCII).
	- A piece of numeric data.
	- A machine instruction, depending on the context.
#### 3. ASCII Representation
- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**: A standard mapping from text characters to unique integer values (0 - 127).
- Each ASCII character is stored as one byte.
	- Example:
		- `#` --> integer value 35.
		- `i` --> integer value 105.
		- `\n` --> integer value 10.

#### 4. Text Files vs Binary Files
- **Text File**: Contains only ASCII characters. Example: `hello.c`.
- **Binary File**: Contains non-text data (e.g., images, executables).
#### 5. Bits + Context Principle
- The same sequence of bits can mean different things depending on context:
	- As an integer.
	- As a floating-point number.
	- As a string of characters.
	- As a machine instructions.

#### 6. Implications for Programmers
- Machine representations of numbers are finite approximations, not the same as true mathematical integers or reals.
- Understanding these representations is crucial to understanding unexpected behaviour in programs.
