### Core Idea
 - Storage is organized in a **memory hierarchy**. Smaller, faster, more expensive devices sit above larger, slower, cheaper ones.
 - Each level acts as a **cache** for the level below it.

---
### Key Points
- The hierarchy allows systems to appear both fast and large by caching frequently used data.
- As you move down the hierarchy:
	- Speed decreases.
	- Cost per byte decreases.
	- Capacity increases.

---
### Typical Hierarchy
- **L0**: Register file. Fastest, smallest.
- **L1 - L3**: Cache levels. Each caches the next.
- **L4**: Main memory (DRAM).
- **L5**: Disk (or SSD).
- **Networked Systems**: Local disk can cache data from remote disks.
