### Core Idea
- Modern systems are connected via networks, allowing them to communicate and share data.
- The network is treated as just another I/O device. Data can be read from or written to it, like a disk or keyboard.

---
#### How Network Communication Works
- When a system copies bytes from main memory to the network adapter, those bytes are sent over the network to another machine.
- When receiving data, bytes are copied from the network into main memory.
- This process enables communication between computers through network hardware and protocols (like TCP/IP).

---
#### Importance of Networking
- One of the most common uses of computers today is data transfer over networks.
- Examples of network-based applications:
	- Email
	- Instant messaging
	- Web browsing (HTTP)
	- File Transfer (FTP)
	- Remote login (telnet, SSH)

---
### Key Concepts
- Client-Server Model:
	- Client requests services (e.g., sending commands).
	- Server provides services (e.g., running programs, sending back data).
- Network I/O = Remove I/O: Sending/receiving data is conceptually the same as local I/O.

---
### Takeaways
- Networking extends system communication beyond local hardware.
- Data transfer over networks follows the same fundamental pattern as other I/O operations.
- Client-server communication underpins nearly all networked applications.
