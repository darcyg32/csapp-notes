### Core Idea
- A computer system is hardware + systems software working together to run application programs efficiently.

### 1. Information Representation & Program Translation
- All information is stored as bits, interpreted based on context (data, instructions, etc.).
- Programs are successively translated:
	1. **Source code** (ASCII text) -->
	2. **Object files** (via compiler) -->
	3. **Executable binaries** (via linker).
- Processors execute binary machine instructions stored in memory.

### 2. Storage Hierarchy
- Systems spend much of their time moving data between CPU, memory, and I/O.
- Storage is organized as a hierarchy:
	- **Registers --> Caches --> Main Memory --> Disk**.
- Higher levels = faster, smaller, more expensive per bit.
- Each level acts as a cache for the one below it.
- Understanding this hierarchy allows programmers to write faster code by exploiting locality.

### 3. Role of the Operating System
- The OS manages hardware and provides key abstractions:
	1. Files: Abstraction of I/O devices.
	2. Virtual Memory: Abstraction of main memory & disks.
	3. Processes: Abstraction of CPU, memory, and I/O combined.
- Acts as a bridge between applications and hardware.

### 4. Networks
- Networks let systems communicate and share data.
- From a system's perspective, a network is just another I/O device.
