### Core Idea
- A program written in a high-level language (like C) must be translated into low-level machine code before it can run.
- This translation is done by other programs collectively known as the compilation system.

### Compilation System Overview
**Goal**: Convert human-readable source code --> machine-executable binary.
**Main tool (on Unix/Linux):** `gcc` compiler driver.

**Stages of Translation**:
1. Preprocessing
2. Compilation
3. Assembly
4. Linking

---
#### 1. Preprocessing Phase (cpp)
**Tool**: Preprocessor
**Input**: `hello.c`
**Output**: `hello.i` (modified C source)

**Purpose**:
Handles preprocessor directives (lines starting with `#`), such as:
- `#include <stdio.h>` --> inserts contents of the system header file `stdio.h` directly into the code.
- `#define` --> replaces macros or constants.

**Result**:
A new C file with all directives expanded.

#### 2. Compilation Phase (cc1)
**Tool**: Compiler
**Input**: `hello.i`
**Output**: `hello.s` (modified language file)

**Purpose**:
Translates the preprocessed C code into **assembly language** (a human-readable, low-level representation of machine instructions).

**Example Output (`hello.s`)**:
```assembly
main:
	subq    $8, %rsp
	movl    $.LCO, %edi
	call    puts
	movl    $0, %eax
	addq    &8, %rsp
	ret
```
- Each line represents one machine instruction in text form.
- Assembly is language-independent. Multiple languages can compile down to the same assembly format.

---
#### 3. Assembly Phase (as)
**Tool**: Assembler
**Input**: `hello.s`
**Output**: `hello.o` (modified object file - binary)

**Purpose**:
- Converts assembly code into actual machine code instructions understood by the CPU.
- Packages the result as a relocatable object program, which can later be linked with other object files.

**Notes**:
- `hello.o` is **binary** (not human-readable).
- Example: 17 bytes might encode all instructions for `main`.

---
#### 4. Linking Phase (Id)
**Tool**: Linker
**Input**s:
- `hello.o` (Your program's object file).
- `printf.o` (Precompiled object file from the C standard library).
**Output**: `hello` (executable object file)

**Purpose**:
- Combines your program's object code with external library code (like `printf`).
- Resolves references between functions and variables across files.
- Produces a complete executable binary ready to be loaded and run.
