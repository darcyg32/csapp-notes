#### Core Idea
- Even though modern compilers handle most translation tasks automatically, programmers benefit greatly from understanding how compilation systems work for **performance, debugging, and security reasons**.

---
####  1. Optimizing Program Performance
- Programmers don't need to know the inner workings of the compiler to write efficient code, but a basic understanding of machine-level code and how the compiler translates different statements can help us make better coding decisions.
	- For example, it can help us understand the tradeoffs between switch and if-else statements, function call overhead, while vs for loops, etc.

#### 2. Understanding Link-Time Errors
- The linker can cause confusing errors, especially when trying to build large software systems.
- It's important to know how the linker works in order to understand errors, understand limitations, and to make good coding decisions.

#### 3. Avoiding Security Holes
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are a common reason for security holes in network and Internet servers.
- A first step in learning secure programming is to understand the consequences of the way data and control information are stored on the program stack.
