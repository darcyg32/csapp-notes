#### Two Categories of Integer Encodings
- **Unsigned**: Only non-negative values.
- **Two's complement (signed)**: Represents negative, zero, and positive.

### 2.2.1 - Integral Data Types (C)
- Types vary by:
	- **Size**: `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`
	- **Signedness**: `signed` (default) or `unsigned`
- Sizes differ between 32-bit and 64-bit programs.
- Ranges aren't symmetric for signed types. There's one extra negative value.
- The C standard defines minimum ranges, not exact ones.
- Fixed-size types (`int32_t`, `uint32_t`, etc.) always have exact sizes and ranges.

---
### 2.2.2 - Unsigned Representation
- Treats bits as a non-negative number.
- Range for $w$ bits:
	- $0$ to $2^w - 1$

---
### 2.2.3 - Two's Complement
- Most common way to store ints.
- MSB = sign bit.
	- MSB = 1 means the number is negative.
- Range for $w$ bits:
	- $-2^{w-1}$ to $(2^{w-1}-1)$

---
### 2.2.4 - Converting Between Signed & Unsigned
- Casting doesn't change bits, only interpretation.
- **Signed --> Unsigned**
	- Positive numbers stay the same.
	- Negative numbers "wrap" into large unsigned ones.
- **Unsigned --> Signed**
	- If value is too large to fit in signed range, it becomes negative.

---
### 2.2.5 - Signed vs Unsigned in C
- Most integers are unsigned by default.
- Adding `U`/`u` suffix makes a constant unsigned.
- Casting or assignments between signed/unsigned follow the bit-preserving rule above.

### 2.2.6 - Expanding the Bit Representation of a Number
When converting a number to a *larger* bit-width:
- **Unsigned --> Larger Unsigned**
	- **Zero Extension**
		- Just add zeros to the left.
		- Value stays the same
- **Two's-Complement --> Larger Two's-Complement**
	- **Sign Extension**
		- Replicate the sign bit (MSB) into the new high bits.
		- Keeps the numerical value unchanged.
		- Binary weights double each time. Adding copies of the MSB preserves the correct magnitude.

---
### 2.2.7 - Truncating Numbers
When reducing a number to fewer bits:
- **Unsigned Truncation**
	- Drop high-order bits.
	- Remaining low bits interpreted as unsigned.
- **Two's Complement Truncation**
	- Drop high bits.
	- Interpret remaining bits with two's complement rules.
	- Can change sign or magnitude drastically because information is lost.

### 2.2.8 - Advice on Signed vs Unsigned
- Avoid unsigned integers for ordinary arithmetic, as they often create bugs.
- Using signed ints reduces weird wrap-around behaviour.
- Mixing signed and unsigned in expressions forced unsigned arithmetic, which can:
	- Convert negative values into huge positives.
	- Break comparisons.
- Unsinged types are mainly for:
	- Bitwise logic.
	- Masks.
	- Low-level binary operations.
	- Sizes, indices (sometimes), but still use with car.
- General rule:
	- Prefer signed unless you specifically need modular arithmetic.
